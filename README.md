# I2C_Protoco-dv
I2C is a synchronous, serial, multi-master, multi-slave communication protocol. It uses only two wires to communicate between devices:
  SCL (Serial Clock Line) – Carries the clock signal
  SDA (Serial Data Line) – Carries the data
I2C is widely used for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripherals such as sensors, EEPROMs, RTCs, and displays.
